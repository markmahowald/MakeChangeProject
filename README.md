## Make Change Project

This project simulates a cash register. A user is asked to enter an item amount, and money tendered.

The program will calculate the change returned by largest denomination. For example: If a customer pays 20$ for an item with cost of 3.96, their change would return as:
 1 ten bill
 1 five bill
 1 one bill
 4 pennies
